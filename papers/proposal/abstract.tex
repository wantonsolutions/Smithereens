\section{Abstract}
\label{sec:abstract}

Ever increasing networking speeds continue to shrink the communication
latency between remote and local CPU cores. Furthermore the
requirements for modern operating systems have seen their complexities
grow on the order of millions of lines of code, decreasing their
performance and increasing their security vulnerabilities.  In this work
we propose an architectural vision for a distributed rack scale
operating system with a centralized kernel and distributed user space.
We draw the line of distribution at the point of privilege escalation.
Privileged kernel code runs on a single centralized host, and user
space processes execute on dedicated remote resources with a razor thin
cache of kernel state for performance.
